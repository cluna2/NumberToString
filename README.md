# NumberToString
Simple Java library that takes a number and converts it to its word form representation. 


This is a hobby project to create an extensible number to word converter that can work in many different languages, and across different formatting types, much in the same vein as ICU4J. 

Currently, only English is supported for numbers up to a few trillion in magnitude.
